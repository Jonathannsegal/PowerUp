Action Packed dual stick shooter. Play with up to 6 people at once with xbox, ps, or OUYA controllers. (MY oppinion OUYA ones are better) To get out of the game and back to the menu just die (don't worry it saves automatically).

## Controlls 🎮

- Works with WASD as well as Bluetooth controllers
- Up to 6 players
- Space bar to shoot
- left joystick move, right to aim, (O, A, X) button to shoot
