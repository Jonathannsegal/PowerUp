# PowerUp

This is a game that I made in middle school and released on the OUYA.

Action Packed dual stick shooter. Play with up to 6 people at once with xbox, ps, or OUYA controllers. (MY oppinion OUYA ones are better) To get out of the game and back to the menu just die (don't worry it saves automatically).
